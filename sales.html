    <h3>The Robinson Line</h3>

    <p>When choosing a helicopter, you need to know how you will be using your helicopter and where you will be flying.</p>

    <h5>R66 Turbine</h5>

    <p>The premier helicopter Robinson offers is the Robinson R66 Turbine. The aircraft is powered by the Rolls Royce RR330 Engine which offers increased reserve power and improved high-altitude performance. This smooth-running aircraft can seat up to 5 people and has large baggage compartment and the very popular upgrade option of auto pilot. The R66 Turbine also comes in a Marine version with pop-out floats.</p>

    <h5>R44 Raven, Raven II, and Cadet</h5>

    <p>The most basic and inexpensive R44 model is the Cadet. This aircraft shares the proven Raven airframe, rotor system, and engine. The main difference is the two rear seats have been removed and reconfigured for a baggage compartment. This aircraft is suitable for training and flight schools and offers an option for air conditioning.</p>

    <p>The R44 Raven is Robinson’s first 4-seat model. This aircraft should be sufficient for low-altitude, low-payload operation at an affordable price. Air conditioning is not an available option for the R44 Raven I.</p>

    <p>The next step up is the R44 Raven II. It has more power allowing for greater payloads and operation at higher altitudes. The Raven II also has options for air conditioning and a fuel-injected engine.</p>

    <p>The next two models of the R44 are the Clipper and Clipper II. Simply put, the Clippers are R44 Ravens with floats. If you will be operating over areas with lots of water you will definitely want to consider Clipper model with pop out emergency floats.</p>

    <h5>R22 Beta II</h5>

    <p>The R22 Beta II is Robinson's two seat helicopter. The low operating costs have made the R22 very popular for training. Most flight schools, including Florida Suncoast Helicopters, rely on the R22 for most of their training.</p>
