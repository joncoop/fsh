title: Pilot Training

<p>Our location in Southwest Florida allows for year-round training. In addition, this area offers many housing options, as well as recreational opportunities. Fishing, boating and golf are some of the popular activities enjoyed by visitors to the region. Disney World in Orlando is less than two hours by car. Miami and Fort Lauderdale, on the east coast of the state, are only about a 3 hour drive.</p>

<p>Florida Suncoast Helicopters is fortunate to be operating in the controlled environment of Sarasota-Bradenton International Airport (SRQ). This provides the student with an additional flight-training benefit, the opportunity to learn communication and navigation skills in real-world conditions.</p>

<p>Whether one is interested in beginning a career in rotorcraft or is a high time, fixed-wing pilot, interested in an add-on rating, Florida Suncoast Helicopter staff would like to help in achieving that goal. We also offer transition training to the Robinson R44, R66, and Bell 206.</p>

      <div class="collapsible-header"><i class="material-icons">add</i>How do I start?</div>
      <div class="collapsible-body">
        <p>Call Florida Suncoast Helicopters, and we will set you up with one of our experienced flight instructors. When you come in for your first lesson, you and your instructor will be able to plan a course of action that will help you meet your goals.</p></div>

      <div class="collapsible-header"><i class="material-icons">add</i>Can I take an introductory flight?</div>
      <div class="collapsible-body">
        <p>Yes you can. We do offer an introductory flight. Time will be spent with your instructor before the flight learning the very basics of the flight controls. Then you will begin the flight portion of your lesson where YOU will get to fly the helicopter with the help of your instructor.

      <div class="collapsible-header"><i class="material-icons">add</i>Should I get a fixed-wing licence first?</div>
      <div class="collapsible-body">
        <p>Helicopters (rotorcraft) and Airplanes (fixed-wing) are considered two different categories by the FAA. Therefore, you do not need any fixed-wing experience to start training.</p>
        <p>If you plan on getting both, we recommend that you start with the helicopter. The ingrained reactions of an airplane pilot can compromise your safety when flying a helicopter. Basically, people tend to revert back to their initial training in an emergency. These emergency “airplane” reactions can compromise your helicopter safety.</p>
        <p>Even if you already have a fixed-wing licence, you can still learn to fly a helicopter. It will just take a little extra effort from you and your instructor to break your airplane habits, but before you know it you will be a safe helicopter pilot.</p>

      <div class="collapsible-header"><i class="material-icons">add</i>What are the age requirements?</div>
      <div class="collapsible-body">
        <p>You can start at any age. You just will not be able to fly the helicopter alone, or “solo” as they say until 16 years of age. You may not be old enough to get your license, but you and an instructor can still do all the dual flight instruction you want.</p>
        <p>A student pilot’s certificate can be issued to you at 16 allowing you to solo the aircraft and train towards all the requirements for a private pilot certificate. Then at 17 you can be eligible for a private pilot certificate.</p>

      <div class="collapsible-header"><i class="material-icons">add</i>What is a “private” pilot certificate?</div>
      <div class="collapsible-body">
        <p>A private pilot is someone who became a pilot for personal reasons such as fun or travel. You will not be able to fly for compensation (i.e. money, cows, goats or pigs), but you will be able to take up family and friends. Depending how often you fly you should be able to achieve a private rating in four to six months.</p></div>

      <div class="collapsible-header"><i class="material-icons">add</i>What are my career options?</div>
      <div class="collapsible-body">
        <p>First you will have to achieve your private pilot rating. Then you will need to do additional instruction for your “commercial” certificate. Your commercial rating will allow you to fly for compensation. This will require more flight training along with more in depth ground school. Starting from zero pilot experience to your earning your commercial rating should take approximately a calendar year.</p>
        <p>The most probable next step is to become a CFI (certified flight instructor). Almost all non-military trained pilots were instructors at one point. CFI jobs are abundant all over the country, and they allow you to build time and experience while getting paid.</p></div>
