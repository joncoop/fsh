<p>Our location in Southwest Florida allows for year-round training. In addition, this area offers many housing options, as well as recreational opportunities. Fishing, boating and golf are some of the popular activities enjoyed by visitors to the region. Disney World in Orlando is less than two hours by car. Miami and Fort Lauderdale, on the east coast of the state, are only about a 3 hour drive.</p>

<p>Florida Suncoast Helicopters is fortunate to be operating in the controlled environment of Sarasota-Bradenton International Airport (SRQ). This provides the student with an additional flight-training benefit, the opportunity to learn communication and navigation skills in real-world conditions.</p>

<p>Whether one is interested in beginning a career in rotorcraft or is a high time, fixed-wing pilot, interested in an add-on rating, Florida Suncoast Helicopter staff would like to help in achieving that goal. We also offer transition training to the Robinson R44, R66, and Bell 206.</p>

      <div class="collapsible-body"><p>Yes you can. We do offer an introduction flight. Time will be spent with your instructor before the flight learning the very basics of the flight controls. Then you will begin the flight portion of your lesson where YOU will get to fly the helicopter with the help of your instructor.

      <div class="collapsible-header"><i class="material-icons">swap_vert</i>Do I have to have my airplane pilot’s license before I start helicopter training?</div>
      <div class="collapsible-body"><p>No you do not. Helicopters (rotorcraft) and Airplanes (fixed-wing) are considered two different categories by the FAA. Therefore, you do not need any fixed-wing experience to start training.</p></div>

    <li>
      <div class="collapsible-header"><i class="material-icons">swap_vert</i>I think I want to get both my fixed-wing and rotorcraft rating. Which should I start first?</div>
      <div class="collapsible-body"><p>Start with the helicopter. The ingrained reactions of an airplane pilot can compromise your safety when flying a helicopter. Basically, people tend to revert back to their initial training in an emergency. These emergency “airplane” reactions can compromise your helicopter safety.</p></div>
