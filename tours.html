<h2 class="sub-heading">Thirty-minute tour</h2>

<p>Almost immediately, upon departure, two notable, local landmarks come into view; The John and Mable Ringling Art Museum and, Ca D’Zan, their recently restored Venetian style mansion on the bay. Continuing along the bayfront, another unusual building stands out among the others. This very purple building is the Van Wezel Performing Arts Hall. Next, one of Sarasota’s newest hotels, the Ritz Carlton, cannot be missed. At this point, a turn to the West takes the flight over the new Ringling Bridge and out to St. Armonds Circle and Lido Key.</p>

<p>A short distance to the South, after crossing over Big Pass, the world famous white sand beaches of Siesta Key appear. From here, the tour makes it return to the airport by flying along the bayfront at Big Pass and over Bird Key.</p>

<p>The flight continues along the beaches. Going to the South, the tour travels along the coast of Siesta Key and Casey Key to the Venice Inlet.</p>

<p>As the mainland approaches, downtown Sarasota and the Sarasota Marina are just ahead.</p>

<p>The northern tour, flies along the coast of Longboat Key. Both of these options offer an opportunity to see many of Sarasota’s spectacular beachfront homes and, possibly, some marine wildlife. Dolphin, Manatee, or even schools of shark or tarpon can often be found in the area.

<h2 class="sub-heading">One-hour tour</h2>
<p>This flight provides the opportunity to see virtually the entire Sarasota coastline, including sites from both the northern and southern tours.</p>
