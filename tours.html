      <p>Take flight along Sarasota’s coast to see its unique downtown architecture, spectacular beachfront homes, world-famous white sand beaches, and marine wildlife.</p>

      <p>Almost immediately upon departure, two notable, local landmarks come into view: The John and Mable Ringling Art Museum and, Ca D’Zan, their recently restored Venetian style mansion on the bay. Continuing along the Bayfront, another unusual building stands out. The very purple building is the Van Wezel Performing Arts Hall.</p>

      <p>A turn to the West takes the flight over the Ringling Bridge and out to St. Armands Circle and Lido Key.</p>

      <p>Passengers on the thirty-minute tour can choose either the southern or northern routes. Our southern tour travels along the coast of Siesta Key and Casey Key to the Venice Inlet and makes it return to the airport by flying along the bayfront at Big Pass and over Bird Key, while the northern tour flies along the coast of Longboat Key.</p>

      <p>Those choosing a one-hour tour will have the opportunity to see virtually the entire Sarasota coastline, including sites from both the northern and southern tours.</p>

      <p>Please call now to book a tour. Personalized gift certificates are also available.</p>
