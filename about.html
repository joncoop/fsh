      <p>Florida Suncoast Helicopters, a family owned business, was established in June 2002. We began with just a single helicopter, but by always putting the customer first we have grown not only to be Sarasota’s longest established and most trusted helicopter operation, but also one of the largest helicopter operations in all of Florida.</p>
