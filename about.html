    <p>Florida Suncoast Helicopters, a family owned business, was established in June 2002. We began with just a single helicopter, but by always putting the customer first we have grown not only to be Sarasota’s longest established and most trusted helicopter operation, but also one of the largest helicopter operations in all of Florida.</p>

    <p>Suncoast helicopters is also consistently one of Robinson’s largest dealers in the World. We offer competitive paralleled support whether it be for sightseeing tours, flight training or the purchase of a new helicopter. We also are a FAA 145 approved maintenance shop for all your Robinson needs.</p>

    <p>Florida Suncoast Helicopters goal is to provide a friendly and professional experience for all our customers.</p>
